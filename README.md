# shinyApp
shinyApp created for Coursera Module


This is a simple shiny app created to fulfull a requirement for the coursera module **Developing Data Products**. The module is part of the **Data Science** specialization.

The app uses the `mtcars` data from the `datasets` package. For the plot, it uses `ggplot2`. The application uses function from the `shiny` package. The app is deployed at [https://bobbytkc.shinyapps.io/shinyApp](https://bobbytkc.shinyapps.io/shinyApp).

This Shiny App allows you to compare the fuel efficiency of a selection of cars from the mtcars dataset.


#Instructions

Simply choose an attribute you are interested in from the dropdown list. The app will categorize the data according to that attribute and plot the fuel efficiency according to the miles per gallon (mpg).

You can also choose a specific vehicle from the drop down list. Pick a vehicle you like and click add to show the vehicle attributes in a table, and to highlight the vehicle you chose on the graph.

Shortforms used: 


1. miles/gallon (mpg)
2. no. of cylinders(cyl)
3. displacement(disp) 
4. horsepower(hp) 
5. rear axle ratio(drat) 
6. weight in 1000lbs(wt) 
7. 1/4 mile time(qsec) 
8. V/S(vs) 
9. transmission(am) (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) 
10. no. of forward gears(gear) 
11. no. of carburetors(carb)
